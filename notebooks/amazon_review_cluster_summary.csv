I wouldn't recommend purchasing these.

Low quality, thin socks. These are just not it. They are made of a very low quality fabric that is thin and feels like my grandpa's old worn out socks from 15 years ago. The slouch is not cute because of how thin the fabric is, and it looks nothing like the photo. These are not warm and not cozy at all. For this price I expected some cushy, soft, thick socks to wear in the winter. These are not it. If you want something like these, find some worn out mens socks a few sizes too large for you.
---
They also are much thinner and are not very cushiony like they were before. I purchased these socks in 2016 and the quality had dropped off significantly.  After wearing the socks for only one day there was significant wear on the socks.  They also are much thinner and are not very cushiony like they were before.  Regret purchase"

Poor Quality--Not Leather. Disappointed, returned shoes.  Order a new pair after old one finally gave out.  They were not leather, poorly made and much more narrow than my other pair.

Won’t buy Reebok again until they sell 99% fit. Love Reebok but they run small. Went with sketchers. They offered more stability for my foot!! Reebok felt like my foot was going to tip over! They did not fit well at all. I tried two different sizes. One larger than the other. Returned both. Now UPS has no record of return!! OMG!! Help!!

I'm Returning These. These are nothing like the Reebok Princess I have worn and loved for years other than that they look like them.  Originally the  Princess was a nice leather;  I thought  I could tolerate the artificial leather they're using now.

Hope you like blisters. So to be honest i wasn’t expecting too much from these boots. First feel they were trendy looking but pretty clunky and heavy. After day one i had a blister which is fine but my feet were so water logged it was painful. There was no breathing to them at all. I get it waterproof boots don’t breathe as well but these things don’t breathe at all period. Day two another blister same spot other foot. i could already feel the soles giving in with no support. The toe box was so uncomfortable to be frank these may have been defective because if they were supposed to be that tight in the toe box that is horribly uncomfortable. Day three my feet were in a lot of pain as the blisters were a day old (that’s the worse) it was quite uncomfortable for me to walk in them as they were just affecting the blistered areas. Last day i would ever wear this horrible boot, i started the day with 4 blisters on one foot and 5 on the other. The only good thing about this boot is it kind of looks cool other then that i wouldn’t recommend to anyone. I’ll stick with my danners.

No longer good!!! Don't buy!. No longer good!<br />I thought I was going crazy, because I had been wearing these shoes for years and years and loved them, always had a pair or sometimes two handy for when the old pair's life was ending, and suddenly the same size didn't fit at all and my feet got extremely smelly and sweaty while wearing them. My old pair still fit and so did other shoes, so it had to be the shoes. But reading these reviews I know that it isn't me... Do not buy these shoes! Bad about this website: I was just chatting with an employee to ask about this issue before reading theses reviews and he told me that nothing changed when I literally asked about it. So that is no way to treat a customer, it's basically a lie... They should be honest about this change, they cheapened the production, making this a bad shoe, not what you could get before.<br />To top it off, I sent in this review at the Reebok website before and it was turned down for not meeting their standards. I checked, nope, it's up to standard alright. I guess Reebok is not into honest criticism? So submitting this review to amazon and other places now, I mean I took the time to write it...

The one advertised is branded while the one I received just says &#34;Luggage Tag&#34; on a basic brown cardboard and it doesn't have the design shown. The BB-8 tag is not BB-8. The head is completely different than what is shown and the colors are way off. Kylo Ren's lightsaber is crooked and details on his helmet are not the same. The same thing with R2, colors, and details are completely off from what is shown. I was so excited for these and now I'm​ returning them.

Fell off with first use. These are darling, but despite my making sure the tags were secured on our suitcases the bands holding them are still flimsy enough that we lost one the first time we used them flying. So, these are not worth spending money on.
---
Does not hold up while traveling. I bought this for our trip to Disney. We used all four and when we got our luggage from the airport two of them were gone. The strap was still in tact but no character on either of them. Super disappointed! My little one really loved these. Would not recommend if they are going to break that easily."

Dissapionted. This was my first pair of Thorogood boot and within 1 week of use on the construction site the sole began to seperate from the boot at the toe. i have never seen this happen with any other brand of boot. It could just be band luck but just putting this up to help out.

Bad design. The problem I had seem to be a common one. The eyelid on the tongue inside of the boot was hurting my ankle. Other than that the boot fit was fabulous.

Lasted less than 6 months :(. I bought these for my husband in February based on great reviews. We live in a cool climate and he wears wool socks daily. He loved these socks!

Within a couple months I noticed that the ball of each remaining sock was wearing through. Now at the end of July every sock from my order either has a gaping hole or is threadbare.

So, I ordered more.<br /><br />The new socks arrived yesterday and they just aren't the same quality as they were less than a year ago.  They are tight.  They are not overly soft.  I will not order again.

Poor quality from Hue. The quality of these socks is not good. After 3 washings they no longer have the ability to stay where they are supposed to be. These socks become loose and the heel will end up by the ball of your foot after 5 minutes of walking. Go to the store and buy the cheapest socks you can find. You'll be just as happy with you socks.

Waste of money!!!. I got four pairs of three of the patterns. Seriously such a rip off. False advertising, too."

They seem nice at 1st. They seem nice at 1st, but they just don't have the longevity of other merino wool socks I own. All of them wore out in the heel, while remaining fine everywhere else, must be the type of stiching, as I assume all merino wool is created more or less equal. Won't be buying these again. Spend more on Smartwool or Wigwam, they'll last much much longer."
44,Unknown,"socks, br, wear, pair, sock, better, new, people, br br, good",16,0.75,"Not Worth The Savings. As many people here, I bought a set of People Socks based on reviews.  I got the sense I was buying high-quality American-made lower-cost socks and was willing to try them out.  I only wear them a couple months of the year, and mostly weekends, so they don't get heavy use.  Out of the box People Socks seem decent, and I liked them so much I bought another set the following year.  HERE'S THE PROBLEM:<br /><br />In 2011, I bought a few Wigwam socks.  See link below.  They're pricey, hence my next purchases:<br />2013: Bought a set of People Socks<br />2014: Bought that second set of People Socks I mentioned earlier.<br /><br />It's 2016, and guess what: as I write this review, I am wearing a pair of my original Wigwams.  ALL of the People Socks I've purchased have worn through the foot and I've thrown them away.  By my math I get three times the wear for only twice the cost.  I'm not saying you should run out and buy Wigwams, but I CAN tell you that sometimes quality IS better than quantity.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000TA74IM Wigwam Men's Hiking/Outdoor Pro Length Sock, Charcoal, Large]]<br /><br />Bonus: People Socks pill like nobody's business.  Wigwams don't.  Though this really only seems to be an aesthetic problem, and they mention it on the PS page, but it's worth mentioning.

Super warm, comfortable socks - They lasted through only TWO wearings!. These socks are incredibly comfortable. I'd say they're right up there with the best socks ever. Why only one star? They ripped completely across the toe seam after only two wearings! Do these socks have some kind of warranty? $17 a pair and they self-destruct after less than a few weeks.<br /><br />FOLLOWUP: I contacted Wigwam socks directly and here is their reply: ""Guruka, please accept our apologies. A replacement pair of socks will be sent. At times a stitch may be missed when the machine knits the toe closing which offers the most comfortable toe seam. Your order number is... Wishing you a safe and healthy holiday. Wigwam.com Customer Service""<br /><br />So they do stand behind their product.

What a disappointment!. I had a pair of Wigwam socks for the last 10 years that I absolutely loved.  They finally got holes in them so I needed a new pair.  Obviously, being so happy with the last pair, I immediately searched for and purchased new Wigwam socks!  What a disappointment these new socks are compared to the old ones.  They don't fit well (way too tight around the calf, and too loose around the foot)(and I have size 13 wide feet), they're much thinner material than the old ones, and they constantly slip down (floppy toe every time you take your shoes off).  I wish I could've returned both pairs but I washed one to see if it got better.  Spoiler: it didn't."

too small, cold. I bought these on someone else’s recommendation and I have size 11 feet so I was wary of socks being too small and ending up stretching till they’re cold. This is exactly what these socks do even though they’re listed as size 9-11. too small, too cold, cheapskate shysters must make these.

They are really low-cut, to the point that you can really only wear them with some very low-cut shoes or else you will get blisters. They barely fit me and I wear a size 11 US usually.

Well made socks but very tight. Wigwam has a great reputation, but the ""calves"" of these socks are really tight if you have heavy (thick) calves.  I bought them because I've had wonderful Wigwam socks in the past, but gave them away because they were much too tight around the calves.

medium so far .Downgraded TO POOR-.6-17-2014. They do not wear well.<br />By 6-17-2014 most were worn out at the heel.<br />I found a Merino 70% blend for 3 pairs at $8 at our local discount outlet.These wear much better.<br />I had bought these before and the Peoples Socks were a poor replacement when the ""OFF BRAND"" became unavailable.<br />I do not recommend the Peoples SOcks."

Hiking Socks. I liked the substantial feel of the material. Definitely will keep my feet warm.

Items were described as fleece lined; they are not. Thin, polyester.. I ordered the thermal underwear for my child to wear under her Halloween costume. Since there isn't time to return them before then, I will keep them. I will see if they provide any warmth. However, both the description and the packaging said ""fleece-lined"" and that is simply not true. I did not get what I expected."

Maybe i'll stick with cotton. Shrunk a bit too much. Not much elasticity to these, think of a whool coat for your foot. Warm, yes, breathe in a boot for swet, no. I throw them on if its cold before work, but they fall and eventually move around in my boot. Size 11 foot, so maybe these work better for someone who doesnt stomp around all day in work boots, with smaller feet.

Great Socks. Gois heavy socks"
51,Unknown,"socks, good, quality, great, price, wool, good quality, feet, warm, comfortable",42,0.95,"Not good. Bad actually.. I wont go as low to say they are garbage, but not far off the mark. They are a little small, a little short, a lot thin, not warm and I'm not the kinda person that gets cold feet easily. Not sure what they are good for... maybe summer...no, to uncomfortable. I'm actually trying to figure out how people suffered thru wearing these long enough to develop holes in them, I couldn't get them off quick enough.  I'm thinking extra socks for the camper or tent in case all your GOOD socks get too wet or dirty these could be a last resort. Or they would make nice toilet paper in an emergency. You could store things in them I suppose. I read the poor reviews and thought, oh people are just being picky, nope they were all accurate. Someone compared them to Haynes socks but I'm pretty sure Haynes are thicker and fit better. Too bad. I really would keep looking. Unless of coarse you need some good toilet paper.

Decent for the amount of money. I did not receive all 3 pairs of socks only two.  So make sure to double check you got all your socks . Material of socks expected with the price I paid for them.

Not really worth the money. I've only worn once, but I didn't notice anything different from normal good quality socks and they are much more expensive than other socks."

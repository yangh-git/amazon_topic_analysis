Wrong. I’ve owned this for about 1-2 months and have yet to even use them on a hike or anything remotely vigorous outdoors and they started to tear. It’s gotten worse since I took these photos and I have just used them for every day things like grocery store and running errands (not much to do right now anyways with COVID).

This last order of socks seemed like some cheap knockoff. The material was thin and the weaves were loose. It's like the company tried to outsource the product. I am so disappointed that I couldn't get what I paid for. I am returning this last order and will search for a better company. The sock on the left is the substandard sock and the sock on the right came from the first order.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />The material seems quality, the feel is very soft and nice. My girlfriend wears a size 5 shoe and I wear anything from an 8-9 mens and the socks fit us both comfortably. I received the small/medium green socks as a gift.<br /><br />The socks do keep my feet warmer and my feet do not sweat.

It is an undershirt, not made to wear as a regular shirt, does exactly as it says. I honestly can't wait to try light colored shirts again.<br /><br />***EDIT as of 5/1/17 - washed the shirt and it actually got tighter and it makes the pad cover less area. Also noticed a little dampness seep through to my button down. Little disappointed. I did not sweat more today than when I first wore it. Granted, it soaked up most of the sweat but still not ALL of it.<br /><br />***2nd EDIT as of 5/15/17 -  wore the shirt for mother's day, doesn't seem to have shrunk more BUT i sweated through the pads at the top and bottom, not in the middle - now very disappointed",9,-0.31224835,4.9771137,Sweat Protection / Undershirt Performance,Sweat Protection / Undershirt Performance

Few design flaws and gimmicky features.,"So I thought since these were thick rubber, looked good, made in the USA, etc, these would be worth the money.<br /><br />To the touch, they feel nice.  I was impressed first unboxing them, but then I realized something kind of gimmicky about them.  The rubber is designed to look like it has a thick sole.  On the exterior, you can see the line where a thick sole would normally start, but once you slide your feet in, they slide right past this border and you realize it's just a superficial exterior line that has nothing to do with the thickness of the sole.  I don't see how these would hold up really well to construction needs when you're stepping on sharp pieces of wood, nails, other junk, etc...<br /><br />Then  I noticed there were huge lumps of rubber on the inside sole of one overboot.  When I flipped it inside out, it looked like it was leftover from the injection molding they did to create the boot, but you could definitely feel it very obviously through my boot.  This wasn't a huge issue as I could slice it off with a razor blade, so I did that so that they were flat.  I hadn't decided against these yet, but then what happened next was a complete deal-breaker.<br /><br />As I had them on and they were finally comfortable and I started walking around, I noticed that my heels started to slide upwards in the overboot, so that there was a space opening up underneath my heel and scuffing on the floor as I walked.  The reason I believe is that the sole footprint size actually tapers inward a bit, so that the heel sole of your actual boot wants to settle somewhere about an inch above the sole of the overboot.  This should not happen as I wear 10.5 size shoes and these are the correct size L overboot.  Walking around with the heels always dragging on the ground because of a space between the heel of my boot and the heel of the overboot would definitely result in a worn out spot on the heel and they would not last long at all.  It at least wasn't worth over $50 to find out. So I'm returning these and back to the drawing board.

I don't see how these would hold up really well to construction needs when you're stepping on sharp pieces of wood, nails, other junk, etc...<br /><br />Then  I noticed there were huge lumps of rubber on the inside sole of one overboot.  When I flipped it inside out, it looked like it was leftover from the injection molding they did to create the boot, but you could definitely feel it very obviously through my boot.  This wasn't a huge issue as I could slice it off with a razor blade, so I did that so that they were flat.  I hadn't decided against these yet, but then what happened next was a complete deal-breaker.<br /><br />As I had them on and they were finally comfortable and I started walking around, I noticed that my heels started to slide upwards in the overboot, so that there was a space opening up underneath my heel and scuffing on the floor as I walked.  The reason I believe is that the sole footprint size actually tapers inward a bit, so that the heel sole of your actual boot wants to settle somewhere about an inch above the sole of the overboot.  This should not happen as I wear 10.5 size shoes and these are the correct size L overboot.  Walking around with the heels always dragging on the ground because of a space between the heel of my boot and the heel of the overboot would definitely result in a worn out spot on the heel and they would not last long at all.  It at least wasn't worth over $50 to find out. So I'm returning these and back to the drawing board.  I wanted to like them, but they actually just look way more durable and practical than they really are.",26,3.0116024,-3.3103266,Work / Durability / Fit,Work / Durability / Fit

Please fix the listing so that the size chart matches the size selections available on Amazon.<br /><br />However, the quality is good. In fact, they are exactly the same as the pair of Stratton shoe trees I already own, except a size smaller. I would wager they are made by the same manufacturer, as the size, shape, finish, hardware, and markings are 100% identical (See photos). However, the Woodlore ones are a few dollars cheaper, so I went with them this time.",3,2.7823846,-4.5681925,Shoe Trees / Sizing & Quality,Shoe Trees / Sizing & Quality

Pull all you want, they will stretch right over most of the boots you are wearing. Snug, secure, comfortable, and will last as long as several pairs of the cheap PVC boots. That's time saved going back to the supply warehouse. That is unless you have some oversized work boots to go into them.<br /><br />With most of my standard sized boots (Wolverine, Bass, etc) in 13W (approx 13 to 13-1/4"" sole length), these slip on and off just fine.<br /><br />The problem is with my Thorogood 13W steel Moc toe wedge boot, which is a copy of a Red Wing 1907. I think Thorogood simply used their sz 14 lasts to make these, as the sole measures 13-7/8"" from end to end (rolling the ruler along the sole). The steel Moc toes simply add to the bulk.<br /><br />The day I decided to get a pair of these (based on recommendations), I was wearing my smaller-soled Wolverines boots. I placed my boot on the measuring display on the side of the box, as well as the Treds measuring decal on the floor at the building supply store, and the measurement showed my boots were well under the max measuring line to use the L/XL sized overboots (odd choice for a boot size, since they also have an XL and XXL). The store didn't carry the XL or XXL, and I knew of only one other store in the county that carried this brand of overboots. Thought they would fit the same on all of my boots. After a couple of uses, though, I realize they just aren't going to work with the larger-soled Thorogood boots, as I discovered when I tried the overboots on them later.<br /><br />I love the Thorogood work boots; it's just that they're too big to fit into these overboots without a ton of effort to get them on and are nearly impossible to get off once forced on. I went back to the supply store and compared the Thorogood boots to the measuring display on the floor and box, and they came up just a hair width below the max measuring line for the L/XL size.<br /><br />I will look for the XL, one size up, for use with these boots or other Moc toe / steel toe boots, on the off chance they too are oversized. Wasn't really planning on getting two pairs, but thats what I am going to have to do. Fortunately, I will get plenty of use out of these pouring concrete, whichever workboots I'm wearing.<br /><br />At the Treds.com website (I discovered after the fact), they have a sizing chart (not available at the retailer I went to; they only had the put-your-shoe-on-the-line sticker on the floor, plus the measuring marks on the product box). The chart shows that a sole length of 13 1/4 - 13 3/4"" should use the L/XL, 13 3/4 - 14 1/2"" should use XL, and 14 1/2 - 15 1/2"" should use XXL. Wish I had that info before I purchased the smaller pair. Now I will end up with two pairs.<br /><br />Finding the XL version here at Amazon takes a bit of work, though. A standard ""Treds over shoe / boot"" search doesn't show the XL model in the results. The seller who markets most of the other sizes here doesn't advertise the XL, and it is instead listed at Amazon under another title... ""Treds XL Over the Shoe 17"" Slush Boot"", part number 17853, ASIN B001I014I8.<br /><br />If you wear longer 13's or 14's workboots, or larger, definitely try these on for size if possible, because they may not fit well.<br /><br />Note: These are not lined.
